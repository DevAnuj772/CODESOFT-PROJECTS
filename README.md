# CodSoft Web Development Internship Projects

## 📄 Overview
This repository contains the front-end web design projects I developed during my Web Development Internship at **CodSoft**. These projects focus on mastering **HTML5** and **CSS3**, demonstrating proficiency in responsive design, layout structuring (Flexbox/Grid), and UI aesthetics without the use of JavaScript.

## 📂 Project Structure
The repository is organized into three main project directories:

1.  **Portfolio Website** - A personal portfolio layout to showcase professional details.
2.  **Landing Page** - A responsive marketing landing page.

* **Display Screen:** Real-time feedback of user inputs and calculation results.
* **Logic Implementation:** Uses `if-else` statements and operators to handle calculation logic.
* **DOM Manipulation:** Event listeners attached via loops to handle button clicks efficiently.
* **Responsive Layout:** Grid-based design ensures proper button alignment.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** Structure of the calculator interface.
* **CSS3:** CSS Grid system for button alignment and styling.
* **JavaScript:** * `forEach` loops for iterating through buttons.
    * `addEventListener` for capturing user input.
    * `if-else` control flow for processing calculations.
