# Calculator

## 📄 Project Description
This project is a functional web-based calculator developed for the **CodSoft Web Development Internship**. It was built to satisfy specific technical requirements, utilizing **CSS Grid** for layout and **JavaScript** for logic handling. The application handles user inputs via event listeners and performs arithmetic operations dynamically.

## ✨ Features
* **Interactive Interface:** Buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* **Display Screen:** Real-time feedback of user inputs and calculation results.
* **Logic Implementation:** Uses `if-else` statements and operators to handle calculation logic.
* **DOM Manipulation:** Event listeners attached via loops to handle button clicks efficiently.
* **Responsive Layout:** Grid-based design ensures proper button alignment.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** Structure of the calculator interface.
* **CSS3:** CSS Grid system for button alignment and styling.
* **JavaScript:** * `forEach` loops for iterating through buttons.
    * `addEventListener` for capturing user input.
    * `if-else` control flow for processing calculations.
